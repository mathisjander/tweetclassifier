# tweetclassifier
[streamlit app](https://mathisjander-tweetclassifier-hatespeech-streamlit-uj854v.streamlit.app) hosting a machine learning classifier to flag text input if it contains hate speech. The model was trained based on a [training data set from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vkrahul/twitter-hate-speech?select=train_E6oV3lV.csv).

The model performance isn't really good or at least deviates from my classification of hate speech. After inspection of the training data, I suspect this to be because of the labels as there are many that I would not agree with.
